# Portfolio Projects
A repository containing all my data science and machine learning projects.

- **Data Science**
  - [Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/yu3ufff/portfolio/blob/main/Stroke%20Prediction.ipynb): Visual analysis on patient data and testing of significance of various features on whether a patient has a stroke or not. Trained a logisitic regression model to predict strokes with a 99.9% accuracy. (Full data science pipeline tutorial).

- **Micro Projects**
  - Gradient Descentt: Implementing linear and logitic regression models using batch gradient descent and comparing performance against sklearn's linear and logistic regression models. Code availabe upon request.
